Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Our client for this project was The Gaming room, and they wanted us to develop a web-based games that serves multiple platforms based on their current came, Draw It or Lose It, which was only available in an android app at the time. Their software requirements were pretty simple, they wanted the ability to have multiple teams involved, teams to have multiple players, unique game and team names, and unique identifiers.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like I tried to break the terms down into the most simple forms rather than using a lot of technical jargon, which made it easier for the client to understand. I also ensured that the client could view all of their options and make the decision on their own. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I feel like it was easier to keep track of what I was doing, and where I planned on going with the development. The continuity alone brought the entire piece together at the end much more smoothly, as each part worked off of the last.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would personally want to study the UML diagram situation a little bit better, as I was definitely confused when I was learning it at first, so it may have had more issues than I had realized. In order to improve it, I would take the knowledge I have now, plus compare side by side with multiple free available UML's to make sure it was done right.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took what the user had requested and wrote it in my design document at the very beginning so that way everytime it was opened, I was reminded about their personal wants and requests. Then I explained why their requests were being made, and any problems we might run into trying to implement these designs. It's important to consider the user's needs while designing, because that's literally what they are paying you for! If you design a product that isn't what the customer asked for, you wasted resources and made our company look bad.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

This time, I approached it very carefully, mostly because I am a novice programmer, so I had to do some extra research in order to understand the difficult concepts that the client requested. I think that I would have to do the same in the future, mostly because technology is always changing, so it's good to always to research to keep up with the advancement in code and programming in general.
